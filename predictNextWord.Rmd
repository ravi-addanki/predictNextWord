## Usage and Limitations

To predict next word in a sentense, open the [Shiny Web App](https://abraun.shinyapps.io/Words_prediction/), enter the phrase and click on 'Predict Next Word'

Instructions for using the app, various features, and limitations can be found on   I N S T R U C T I O N S   tab

This app is based on n-Gram modeling. For example, a 3-Gram model is developed by first computing statistics for the combination of 3 consecutive words in a sentense.

The dataset used is sourced from [SwiftKey-Cousera weblink](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip) 



## Predicting Next Word

- Prediction is made based on n-Gram (1-Gram, 2-Gram, 3-Gram) word statistical models 
- Probability of next word is computed based on [Language Modeling][1] course notes
- Smoothed Estimation of Trigram Models with Discounting methods and bucketing is used
- Once the sentense is bucketed: for each word,

    $$ Probability = L_1 * P_3 + L_2 * P_2 + L_3 * P_1$$
    
    where $L_1, L_2, L_3$ are weightages for 3,2,1-Gram models
    
    and $P_3, P_2, P_1$ are discounted probabilities based on 3,2,1-gram models.

## Data Preparation

- Data sourced from [SwiftKey-Cousera weblink](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip) was extracted 
- Non-English characters, numbers, white-spaces, Punctuation, one/two character words, and stop words were removed 
- Special characters (/032 and /007) were removed
- Data was split into 98% Training set and 2% Development set
- Term Document matrix (TDM) processing was optimized to adher to the memory limits (16GB RAM) by using file system while generating/summarizing 3-Gram or 4-Gram tokens.
- To control the volume less frequent word combinations (<5 in the whole set) were ignored
- Size of final data file prepared (deployed on shiny io) is 20 Mb 
- Object size of data sets once read into memory is 250 MB

## Stepping stones for success (a.k.a failed models)

- Attempts to modify the model by using skipped word feature (considering word combinations separated by one or two words) did not yeild much benefit with real world examples.

- Attempts to modify the model by restricting the words list to the dictionary (i.e. the words that make up the 90% of word instances) and ignoring other words resulted in negative gains (based on limited testing)


## Successful model
- The successful model was the one that used triGram model suggested by Language Modeling  course notes[^1] which is based on Markov chains with Smoothed Estimation and Linear interpolation with bucketing.
- The successful model was trained more than 100 iterations to calulate perplexity and find the optimal Linear coefficients in each bucket.
- The failed attempts seems to suggest that the model accuracy can be improved only by incorporating rules of grammer (semantics) into the model. Further research is required in this direction.
